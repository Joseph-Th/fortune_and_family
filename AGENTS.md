# Agent Guide

**BCA policy:** advisory


**Rust agent diagnostics:** advisory. Use bounded cargo-modules structure views only when the file-header/architecture routing still leaves ownership unclear, targeted cargo-mutants selection/execution when focused command, persistence, or invariant tests may not constrain a consequential rule, and cargo-expand only when generated Rust is material. These diagnostics do not replace the completion lanes in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

**Profiles:** Universal, Stateful Application, Deterministic System, Automated Behavior Evaluation, Artifact Generation

Execution card for repository work. `ARCHITECTURE.md` owns structure and mutation contracts, `STATUS.md` owns capability and schemas, `TESTING.md` owns test policy, `DESIGN.md` owns intent, `GAMEPLAY_HARNESS.md` owns harness semantics. Root `../AGENTS.md` owns workspace coordination, task leases, and filesystem hygiene.

## Workspace contract

Applies to every agent in every harness. Source, rationale, and evidence: [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

The user is a solo developer. Precedence: the user's current request → this contract → the project's `AGENTS.md` → the standards reference. Rules marked **hard** hold even when the user says to ignore the workflow.

### AG-1 Finish the work

Finish the task before reporting. Don't stop at a plan or a progress update, and don't defer requested work into notes. Delegate only bounded, read-only work to subagents.

### AG-2 Make the calls yourself

Design and implementation decisions inside the task are yours. Choose the approach a strong senior engineer would choose, state the choice in one line, and keep going. Ask only when the answer would change what the user gets and you cannot infer it from the request, the code, or common sense.

### AG-3 Stay in your project (hard)

Work only inside the project the task is about. If your session starts at the workspace root, identify that project from the request and work there. Never create top-level directories, and never write output to the workspace root or a project's parent. Temporary output goes in the project's ignored output location (normally `target/agent-output/`) or the OS temp directory.

### AG-4 Done means the user's copy works (hard)

Before you say done:

- Re-read the original request and check every requirement against the actual result by running it, opening it, or looking at it.
- Rebuild the release binary, redeploy the site, or restart whatever the user will actually run, and say that it's current.
- For consequential code changes, go through [`REVIEW.md`](../REVIEW.md) against your diff.

Never claim something is fixed, verified, deployed, or certain unless you checked it. Report what you did not verify.

### AG-5 Look at what you made

For anything seen or heard (graphics, UI, charts, animation, audio, documents), render it and inspect it yourself against the matching rubric in [`STANDARDS_QUALITY.md`](../STANDARDS_QUALITY.md) before calling it done.

- Look at individual assets up close and from several angles, not a crowded overview.
- Compare against the references.
- Check that every output file was actually produced.
- Keep iterating until you would be proud to show it.

Include the screenshots or rendered files in your report. Tests prove behavior, not appearance.

### AG-6 Real behavior over proxies

A passing harness, test, validator, or metric is evidence, not the goal. The goal is the behavior the user experiences. Observe it directly and judge it with common sense against how the real world works. Fix a harness that diverges from the product rather than tuning the product to the harness. Never make a gate pass by weakening it, hardcoding the expected outcome, suppressing warnings, or retrying until green. Simulations get emergent, parameterized systems, not scripted outcomes (STANDARDS_QUALITY.md QUAL-3).

### AG-7 Answer first, then stop talking

When the user asks a question, the first sentence answers it directly. Don't act on a question as though it were a request. Reports are short:

- what changed;
- what you verified and how;
- what you did not verify;
- anything the user must do.

No lectures, recaps, hedging paragraphs, or repeated caveats, and never keep raising a topic the user has dismissed. Put long material (audits, research, data) in a file in the project and link it.

### AG-8 Own mistakes; trust the user's evidence

When the user says something is broken, believe them and re-check your own work before suspecting their setup. Say plainly when you were wrong, then fix it. Never claim a tool, file, or capability is unavailable without actually trying it.

### AG-9 The outcome outranks the process

Standards and workflows exist to make results better. When a documented procedure would make the requested result worse, or cost far more than it protects, favor the result and note in one line what you skipped. This never overrides a hard rule.

### AG-10 Leave nothing running

Before you finish, stop every process, server, watcher, and terminal you started. Release file locks, and delete temporary builds and scratch files you created. Software you build must not leave orphaned child processes when it closes. Never kill or replace a program the user is running without saying so.

### AG-11 Git: `main`, commit, push (hard)

Work on `main`, and don't create branches or worktrees unless asked. When the work is complete and verified, commit and push `main` unless the user said not to. Other agents' changes in the tree may go in with yours when they are sound progress. Never revert, stash, or discard work you did not make; leave out anything clearly broken that isn't yours, and mention it.

### AG-12 Current docs describe the present

When behavior changes, update the one document that owns that fact. No history, war stories, changelogs, or session notes in current docs or comments. Design and roadmap documents are not proof that something is implemented.

### AG-13 CI is local; GitHub Actions are banned (hard)

All builds, tests, checks, and audits run through repository-owned local commands. Never create, enable, invoke, or push `.github/workflows/`; existing workflow files are defects to remove.

## Profiles

**Universal, Stateful Application, Deterministic System, Automated Behavior Evaluation, Artifact Generation.** Universal rules apply throughout; persistence and projection follow DATA and the stateful OWN rules; harness evaluation in `src/gameplay/` follows the Automated Behavior Evaluation companion; procedural art in `src/art/` and HTML/report output follow the Artifact Generation companion with PROD-1.

## Procedure

1. Inspect working-tree state (`git status --short`); preserve unrelated concurrent work.
2. Read `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, and the relevant section of `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
3. Trace the public entry point (`src/lib.rs` → `src/systems/*`) to the owning module. Read its file header (`Purpose / Owns / Reads / Mutates / Does not own / Canonical operations / Relevant invariants / Focused tests`) before editing.
4. Identify the narrowest test that proves the change. Run before editing only to reproduce a failure; otherwise run once behavior is ready.
5. Select the smallest completion lane from `TESTING.md` that owns the changed surface.
6. Update the one document that owns any changed architecture, behavior, schema, API, command, harness, or scope contract.

## Routing

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Campaign construction | `src/systems/bootstrap.rs` |
| Player commands | `src/systems/commands/` (dispatch `mod.rs`, family submodules) |
| Daily / scheduled simulation | `src/systems/simulation/` (daily), `src/systems/strategic/` (weekly/monthly/annual) |
| Legal / progression | `src/systems/legal.rs`, `src/systems/progression.rs` |
| Persistence & validation | `src/persistence.rs`, `src/systems/invariants.rs` |
| Read models / HTML | `src/projection.rs` |
| Gameplay analysis | `src/gameplay/` |
| Procedural art | `src/art/` |
| Core types & state | `src/core/`, `src/ids.rs`, `src/money.rs`, `src/rng.rs`, `src/registry/` |

Impact map: `ARCHITECTURE.md` § Extension map lists required companion work per change class (state shape → validation/invariants/projection/tests; commands → feedback/projection/harness; schedule → ordering/tests; persistence → schema/round-trip; adapters → smoke).

## Guardrails

- `Registry` owns immutable definitions; `AppState` and its stores own serializable runtime state; systems own validation and mutation; adapters (CLI, persistence, projection, HTML, gameplay, art) translate IO only and own no domain rules.
- Consequential operations validate references, ownership, permission, lifecycle, capacity, ranges, and arithmetic before one atomic commit; rejection preserves state and reports a typed `CommandError` / `SimulationError` variant.
- Multi-record work resolves the complete result before commit or uses a consumed `Validated*` token with current-state revalidation; stale tokens fail without mutation.
- Preserve state-owned deterministic randomness (`AppState.rng`), ordered `BTreeMap` iteration with typed-ID tie-breakers, fixed-point `Money`/`Quantity` with `i128` intermediates, checked scheduling (`checked_future_day`), and explicit overflow handling.
- Persistent identity uses typed IDs (`src/ids.rs`); optional relations are explicit `Option<T>`; authoritative records and owned indexes/lifecycle memberships update coherently via store methods.
- Core systems perform no implicit IO. Durable external work is represented in state before an adapter performs it.
- Project-owned enums are exhaustive; consequential fields are private; domain failures use typed errors with variant fields, not string parsing; replaced internal paths are deleted.
- History is append-only via `HistoryLog<T>` (cheap clone, structural checksum); `CampaignEvidenceMemo` and checksum memos are pure derivations excluded from serialization/equality and rebuilt lazily.
- Ad hoc saves, reports, captures, and scratch copies belong under ignored `target/agent-output/<task>/` or an OS temp dir, never in `../` or the workspace root. Remove task-owned transient output before handoff.
- Verification is local: `bash scripts/test.sh <lane>` (or `.\scripts\test.ps1 <lane>` on Windows). Do not create or depend on GitHub Actions workflows; `python ../tools/check_no_github_actions.py` must pass.

## Completion

For iteration use `bash scripts/test.sh fast <filter>` only to isolate a failure or shorten feedback. For completion go directly to `standard`; an extra `fast` beforehand adds no evidence.

For specialized surfaces run the smallest lane in `TESTING.md` that owns the changed contract plus only genuinely distinct evidence that lane does not already contain. Deeper lanes are required only when their distinct contract changed.

Before handoff confirm canonical ownership, deterministic/persistence/invariant behavior, current documentation, clean diff hygiene, and that no `target/agent-output` or workspace-root transient remains.
